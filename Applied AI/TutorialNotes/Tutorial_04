Algorithms = BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*

informed algorithms:
- Dijkstra - pathcost
- A* - pathcost + heuristic - informed

environemt - informed, uninformed 

uninformed algorithms:
- BFS
- DFS

initial state:
- the state where the search starts

goal state:
- the state where the search ends   

pathcost:
- the cost of the path from the initial state to the goal state
no of steps:
- the number of steps it takes to reach the goal state from the initial state


bfs - no of steps
dfs - pathcost

SLD -straight line distance 

f(n) = g(n) + h(n) 
h(n) - heuristic h(n) <= SLD(n)
